### ReadMe
This is a dump of my personal study notes for DP200 and DP201. The input for these notes was the Skills Measured PDF from the DP-200/ DP-201 certification pages. I basically made summary excerpts for all the skills listed in the PDF. Most notes contain a link to the relevant documentation.

**How do these notes benefit me?**
- You can use these notes to detect if there are gaps in your knowledge for the examn:
    - At the time of writing, all notes **are in scope** for the examn (e.g. all notes are relevant)
    - However, there may be **new** topics/ skills in the examn that are not listed in the examn (the measured skills changed frequently in 2019)
- Don't rely on me too much, verify the note contects for yourself by visiting the official Azure documentation pages. I'm a human and make mistakes
